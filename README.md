KISS - Kerbal Improved Save System

is an add-on for the game Kerbal Space Program that improves the default "Quicksave as..." mechanic (when pressing [MOD] + F5).

KISS overwrites the default "Quicksave As..." dialog and instead lists all previous quicksave files in the directory.
This allows you to easily pick a filename to overwrite or to create a variation of a previous quicksave without the need to a) memorize quicksave names and b) type the full name every time.
If you do not select one of the previous filenames, the default suggestion is the current timestamp instead of the unspecific "quicksave #<number>" that the unmodded game uses.
