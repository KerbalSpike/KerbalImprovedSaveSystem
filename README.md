KISS - Kerbal Improved Save System
==================================

is an add-on for the game Kerbal Space Program that provides an improved "Save game as..." mechanic while in flight.

The KISS window is activated by pressing **"F8"** (can be configured, see notes below) and provides the same functionality as
the stock "Quicksave as..." dialog (*"MOD"+"F5"*) for creating named savegames. In addition KISS provides the following improvements:

1. It lists all existing savegames for your current game and allows you to select a previous savegame to overwrite it.
2. The suggested name for the new savegame can be configured:
   * the current timestamp and the name of the active vessel (ship) (*"{timestamp}_{vesselName}"*) (default).
   * the name of the active vessel (ship) and the current timestamp (*"{vesselName}_{timestamp}"*).
   * *"quicksave"* (useful for quicksave mode).
3. The timestamp can be either your current system time ("YYYYMMDD_hhmmss") or KSP ingame time ("Y1_D01_0_24_56").
4. Quicksave mode: if enabled pressing **"F8"** will instantly save your current game without showing any GUI (press **"MOD" + "F8"** to show window again).
5. It allows you to delete old savegames directly from within the game!
6. It can create savegames while in a vessel that is moving on the ground (because it pauses the game before saving)!

In other words: **KISS** allows you to manage your quicksaves without the need to memorize quicksave names!

#### Known limitations of the keybinding feature: ####
* you **can't** bind any modifier keys (Shift, Ctrl, Alt, Command,...) and you also **can't** have any key combinations for KISS, you can only pick a simple, single key.
* you have to disable Capslock before assigning a new key if you want to make sure it is labeled correctly in the UI. Unfortunately it is currently impossible in Unity to check if Capslock is on.
* on international keyboards, you have to hit special keys twice(like the accent keys " Â´ " and " ^ " on the German keyboard), because they do not produce a character when hit for the first time, but I need the character to label the key correctly.
* all keys that to not produce characters like Backspace, Arrow Keys, etc. are labeled with their English names, regardless of keyboard language used.
* the "Print" key is for some reason not detected by my code (although it is listed as a viable KeyCode in Unity).

### Current version: 2.4.2 ###
