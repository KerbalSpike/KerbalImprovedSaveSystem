KISS - Kerbal Improved Save System

is an add-on for the game Kerbal Space Program that provides an improved "Save game as..." mechanic while in flight.

The KISS window is activated by pressing "F8" and provides the same functionality as the stock "Quicksave as..." dialog ("MOD"+"F5") for creating named savegames.
In addition KISS provides the following improvements:
1) the suggested name for the savegame is the current timestamp and the name of the active vessel (ship) (YYYYMMDD_hhmmss-<vesselName>)* instead of the generic "quicksave [#<number>]" pattern.
2) It lists all existing savegames for your current game and allows you to select a previous savegame to overwrite it.

* = timestamp is in system time, not ingame time!

KISS allows you to easily pick a filename to overwrite or to create a variation of a previous quicksave without the need to a) memorize quicksave names and b) type the full name every time.
If you do not select one of the previous filenames, the default suggestion is the current timestamp instead of the unspecific "quicksave #<number>" that the unmodded game uses.
