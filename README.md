KISS - Kerbal Improved Save System
==================================


is an add-on for the game Kerbal Space Program that provides an improved "Save game as..." mechanic while in flight.  

The KISS window is activated by pressing **"F8"** and provides the same functionality as the stock "Quicksave as..." dialog (*"MOD"+"F5"*) for creating named savegames. In addition KISS provides the following improvements:
1.  The suggested name for the new savegame is the current timestamp and the name of the active vessel (ship) (*YYYYMMDD_hhmmss-{vesselName}*) instead of the generic *"quicksave [#{number}]"* pattern.
2.  It lists all existing savegames for your current game and allows you to select a previous savegame to overwrite it.

KISS allows you to easily pick a savegame to overwrite or to create a variation of a previous quicksave without the need to memorize quicksave names and without the need to type the full name every time!
