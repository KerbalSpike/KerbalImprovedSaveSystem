KISS - Kerbal Improved Save System

is an add-on for the game Kerbal Space Program that improves the default "save game as" mechanic.

KISS overwrites the default "Quicksave As..." dialog (when Pressing [MOD] + F5) and instead displays all previous quicksaves in the directory.
This allows you to easily pick a filename to overwrite or to create a variation of a previous quicksave without the need to a) memorize quicksave names and b) type the full name every time.
If you do not select a previous filename, the default suggestion is the current timestamp instead of the unspecific "quicksave #<number>" that the unmodded game uses.
