KISS version history
====================

1.1.0-beta1, 2016-04-15
	Changed:	Rebuilt the GUI code to work with KSP 1.1 and Unity 5. (Fortunately everything still works with KSP 1.0.5, yay!)
	Changed:	Adjusted the yellow textcolor to be slightly daker/more orange.
	
	Known Issues:
	-	Some flickering of the window occurs when scrolling reaches the end of the list.
		(This is possibly related to a bug that got fixed in Unity 5.3.3 but KSP is still using Unity 5.2.)
