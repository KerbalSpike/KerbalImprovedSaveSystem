Things to implement, roughly in order of (decreasing) importance:
=================================================================
*) More sorting options. Perhaps sorting on game time, real time etc?

==================================================
* More sorting options. Perhaps sorting on game time, real time etc?
** It would be required to somehow get the necessary information. I see 2 possible solutions:

    1. looking directly into the save file to get things like the game time and the current vessel, even if those are not in the file name.
    2. or to put for example both game time AND real time into the file name and make it possible to select which one should be displayed.

	I have avoided 1. so far to keep things as simple as possible (the acronym for the plugin is no coincidence :D ), and 2. might result in really long file names...
	
* This plugin allows some characters in the filename of the save that KSP doesn't like. For instance my ship is called MunLander1.1 (yes, with a dot), and the KISS popup lets me save the game like '20180824_202111_MunLander1.1'.

* Programmable timed savings (with sequential naming)



-----------
Known bugs:
-----------
*) if a savegame gets selected whichs name is longer than the current cursor position in the textbox, the cursor position is not updated to the last position of the text.




finished stuff:
***************
*) Add option to reverse sorting of list.
**) Sort list according to reverse sorting option.
*) Store options configured on settings panel into plugin-cfg for persistence between game sessions
*) Add option to default filename to "quicksave" for fast quicksaving
*) Figure out how to properly built a yes/no dialog and implement one
**) Make Save button adhere to the confirm overwrite option
**) Make delete button adhere to the confirm delete option
*) Make dialog appear at the center of the KISS window instead of center of screen.
*) Make the timestamp adhere to the game time option.
*) Make KISS also available in the space center.
