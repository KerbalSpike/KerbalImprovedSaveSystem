Things to implement, roughly in order of (decreasing) importance:
=================================================================
* This plugin allows some characters in the filename of the save that KSP doesn't like. For instance my ship is called MunLander1.1 (yes, with a dot), and the KISS popup lets me save the game like '20180824_202111_MunLander1.1'.

* refactor code to make it cleaner
* replace legacy UI with modern UI
* implement loading of savegames

-----------
Known bugs:
-----------
*) if a savegame gets selected whichs name is longer than the current cursor position in the textbox, the cursor position is not updated to the last position of the text.
